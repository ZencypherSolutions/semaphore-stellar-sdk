# Semaphore SDK for Stellar üåü

Easily integrate Semaphore's  zero-knowledge privacy-preserving functionality into your Stellar-based applications.



## About Semaphore and Stellar Integration

### **What is Semaphore?**
Semaphore is a cutting-edge privacy layer leveraging **zero-knowledge proofs** to enable anonymous participation in group activities such as voting, signaling, and endorsements. Users can verify their membership in groups and perform activities on **EVM-compatible blockchains** without revealing their identity.

### **Why Stellar?**
Stellar's rapidly growing ecosystem lacks privacy-preserving solutions that are already standard in many EVM chains. Integrating Semaphore with Stellar will bring **proven zero-knowledge privacy technology** to a new blockchain, empowering developers to build secure, private, and decentralized applications for Stellar‚Äôs expanding user base.
